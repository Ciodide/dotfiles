Some config dotfiles backup for my own Linux. 

Most of files I wrote are licensed by Unlicense License, but some file was copy or modified from else where.
* .emacs.d/rime
** build
   All file are build from "pinyin-simp" 
   https://github.com/rime/rime-pinyin-simp
   But I mod amd combine the "schema.yaml" with rime's own "double_pinyin_flypy.schema"
